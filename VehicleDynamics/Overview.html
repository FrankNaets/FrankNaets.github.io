<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In recent years, a range of derivative technologies arrived which exploit (flexible) multibody simulation paradigms:
<ul>
<li> Model based state-estimation REFs; </li>
<li> Model based control. </li>
</ul>
However, the general application of these approaches to multibody systems, has two main difficulties:
<ul>
<li> Many of the methodologies develop for estimation and control, assume an ODE description for the underlying model; </li>
<li> As many of these technologies are aimed toward fast/online or multi-query settings, model simulation cost is an important issue. </li>
</ul>
This work proposes a reduced flexible multibody formulation which allows to describe general multibody problems with a range of desirable properties not encountered in current methods.

u(t) = Ae^{-bt}\sin (w t), \hbox{ for } t\in [0,T]
\). </p>

<h2> Msdethodology overview </h2>
<p> The first two steps which rely on external software are briefly discussed in the following section.
  The next section are then focussed on describing the reduced order modeling scheme.

<h2> Training Simulation </h2>
<p>
In this work it is assumed that the original model contains only flexible bodies. In general, the differential algebraic equations describing the motion of the system can be written as:
In these equations the inertial forces are generally a nonlinear function of the generalized
multibody coordinates \(q\) and their velocities \(\dot{q}\).
The same is true for the damping forces \(F_{damp}\) and internal elastic forces in the bodies \(F_{int}\).
$$
\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}
$$
with \(n \in \RR\).
